## What are the different types of lenses?
An intraocular lens (IOL) is a small artificial lens that replaces the eye's natural lens during cataract surgery. The IOL provides similar focusing power to the natural lens. The different types of lenses typically used in cataract surgery are rigid lenses and foldable lenses. They determine the incision size. Most patients would favour a foldable lens as the immediate recoveyif faster. Among the foldable lenses, commonly used ones include monofocal lenses that correct for distance, EDOF or extended depth of focal lenses, and multifocal lenses. Toric lenses are specially designed lenses that correct astigmatism. These lenses are available from both Indian and imported manufacturers. There are also other specific variations used for specific eye conditions. If needed, ask your doctor about the IOL (Intraocular lens). The most common type of lens used with cataract surgery is a monofocal IOL. It is called monofocal because it has one focusing distance. It is set to focus for close work, medium range or distance vision – chosen depending on your visual needs. Like most people you may wish to have it set for clear distance vision; this is best for driving, walking and seeing people at a distance. Generally eyeglasses are needed for reading or close work. A variant of the monofocal lens is the  Aspheric IOLs that mimic the curvature of the eye’s natural lens and increase sharpness marginally especially in low light conditions. Toric IOLs can correct astigmatism (cyindrical power) because, like the astigmatic eye, they also have different powers in different directions that balances the eye’s astigmatism. A multifocal IOL is a premium IOL that provides both distance and near focus at the same time. The IOL has different zones set at different focusing powers. It may allow you to see clearly in the distance without glasses as well as read or use a computer, also without using glasses (although you still may need glasses for some circumstances eg reading small newspaper print). EDOF or extended dept of vision IOLs which enhance the depth-of-focus . There are also lenses that combine the various atributes described. Based on your eye and lifestyle , recheck with your doctor if you want to understand your best option.

## What are the differences between these types of lenses?
The difference in these IOLs is largely on how light entering the eye is focussed. In monofocal IOLs (in which light is focused on one single point), in MF IOLs (having 2 or 3 discrete points) while in EDOF IOLs there is a continous focal range. Based on the IOL selected the requirement of spectacles post surgery would thus vary. Requirement of corrective for intermediate and near tasks would be significantly less when implanted with an EDOF IOL or multifocal IOL rather than a Monofocal IOL.

There are many types of lenses used in cataract surgery. The most commonly used are the Monofocal Lens, which gives you clear distance vision. You would typically need additional correction to view clearly objects and perform tasks for intermediate and near distances.
