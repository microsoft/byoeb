COMBUSTION  AND FLAME COMBUSTION  AND FLAME
We use dif ferent kinds of fuel for
various purposes at home, in
industry and for running
automobiles. Can you name a few fuels
used in our homes? Name a few fuels
used in trade and industry. What fuels
ar
e used for running automobiles? Y our
list will contain fuels like cowdung,
wood, coal, charcoal, petrol, diesel,
compressed natural gas (CNG), etc.
You ar e familiar with the bur ning of a
candle. What is the difference between the
burning of a candle and the burning of a
fuel like coal? May be you were able to
guess right: candle burns with a flame
whereas coal does not. Similarly, you will
find many other materials burning
without a flame. Let us study the chemical
process of burning and the types of flame
produced during this process.
4.1 What is Combustion?
Recall the activity of burning of
magnesium ribbon per formed in
Class VII. W e lear nt that magnesium
burns to form magnesium oxide and
produces heat and light (Fig. 4.1).
We can per form a similar activity with
a piece of charcoal. Hold the piece with
a pair of tongs and bring it near the
flame of a candle or a  Bunsen bur ner.
What do you observe?
We find that char coal bur ns in air .
We know that coal, too, bur ns  in air
producing carbon dioxide, heat and
light.We wer e told that
food is a fuel for
our body.
Fig. 4.1 : Burning of magnesium
A chemical process in which a
substance reacts with oxygen to give
off heat is called combustion . The
substance that undergoes combustion
is said to be combustible. It is also called
a fuel. The fuel may be solid, liquid or
gas. Sometimes, light is also given off
during combustion, either as a flame or
as a glow.
In the reactions mentioned
above magnesium and charcoal are
combustible substances.

Rightly so. In our body
food is broken down by
reaction with oxygen and
heat is pr oduced. W e
learnt that in Class VII.
Can you name some more
substances which ar e combustible? Y ou
can add  those to Table 4.1.
Let us investigate conditions under
which combustion takes place.
COMBUSTION  AND FLAME 41chimney [Fig. 4.2(a)]. Observe what
happens to the flame. Now remove
the blocks and let the chimney rest
on the table [Fig. 4.2(b)]. Again
observe the flame. Finally, put a
glass plate over the chimney [Fig.
4.2(c)]. W atch the flame again. What
happens in the three cases? Does
the flame flicker off? Does it flicker
and give  smoke? Does it burn
unaffected? Can you infer anything
at all about the role played by air in
the process of burning?
We find that for combustion, air is
necessary. The candle burns freely in
case (a) when air can enter the
chimney from below. In case (b), when
air does not enter the chimney from
below, the flame flickers and produces
smoke. In case (c), the flame finally
goes off because the air is not
available.

sometime? Can you think of the
reason why it stops burning?
You might have hear d that when the
clothes of a person catch fire, the personWe have r ead that the sun
produces its own heat and
light. Is it also some kind of
combustion?
In the sun, heat and light are
produced by nuclear r eactions. Y ou
will learn about this process in higher
classes.
During extreme heat
of summer , at some
places dry grass
catches fire. From
the grass, it spreads
to trees, and very
soon the whole forest
is on fire (Fig. 4.4). It
is very difficult to
control such fires.

whose clothes caught fire
Now recall some of your experiences.
Does a matchstick burn by itself?
How does it burn?
You must have had an experience of
burning a piece of paper . Does it bur n
when a burning matchstick is brought
near it?
Can you burn a piece of wood by
bringing a lighted matchstick near it?
Why do you have to use paper or
kerosene oil to start fire in wood or coal?
Have you heard of forest fires?is covered with a blanket to extinguish

Rationalised-2023-24
COMBUSTION  AND FLAME 43We find that a combustible substance
cannot catch fire or burn as long as its
temperature is lower than its ignition
temperature. Have you ever seen
cooking oil catching fire when a frying
pan is kept for long on a burning stove?
Kerosene oil and wood do not catch fire
on their own at room temperature. But,
if kerosene oil is heated a little, it will
catch fire. But if wood is heated a little,
it would still not catch fire. Does it mean
that ignition temperature of kerosene oil
is lower than that of wood? Does it mean
that we need to take special care in
storing kerosene oil? The following
activity shows that it is essential for a
substance to reach ignition temperature
to burn.
Activity 4.4
(Caution : Be careful while handling
burning candle).
Make two paper cups by folding a
sheet of paper . Pour about 50 mL of
water in one of the cups. Heat both
the cups separately with a candle
(Fig. 4.5). What do you observe?The history of the matchstick is very
old. More than five thousand years
ago small pieces of pinewood dipped
in sulphur were used as matches in
ancient Egypt. The modern safety
match was developed only about two
hundred years ago.
A mixture of antimony trisulphide,
potassium chlorate and white
phosphorus with some glue and
starch was applied on the head of a
match made of suitable wood. When
struck against a rough surface, white
phosphorus got ignited due to the heat
of friction. This started the
combustion of the match. However ,
white phosphorus proved to be
dangerous both for the workers
involved in the manufacturing of
matches and for the users.
These days the head of the safety
match contains only antimony
trisulphide and potassium chlorate.
The rubbing surface has powdered
glass and a little red phosphorus
(which is much less dangerous).
When the match is struck against
the rubbing surface, some red
phosphorus gets converted into white
phosphorus. This immediately reacts
with potassium chlorate in the
matchstick head to produce enough
heat to ignite antimony trisulphide
and start the combustion.Do these experiences tell you that
different substances catch fire at
different temperatures?
The lowest temperature at which a
substance catches fire is called its
ignition temperature.
Can you tell now why a matchstick
does not catch fire on its own at room
temperature? Why does the matchstick
start burning on rubbing it on the side
of the matchbox?

become hot?
Rationalised-2023-24
SCIENCE 44If we continue heating
the cup, we can even boil
water in the paper cup.
Can you think of an
explanation for this
phenomenon?
The heat supplied to
the paper cup is
transferred to water by
conduction. So, in the
presence of water , the
ignition temperature of
paper is not reached.
Hence, it does not burn.
The substances which
have very low ignition
temperature and can
easily catch fire with
a flame are called
inflammable substances . Examples of
inflammable substances are petrol,
alcohol, Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG)
etc. Can you list some more inflammable
substances?
4.2How Do W e Contr ol Fir e?
You must have seen or hear d of fir e
breaking out in homes, shops and
factories. If you have seen such an
accident, write a short description in
your note book. Also, share the
experience with your classmates.
It is important that all of us
know the telephone numbers
of the fire service.Fig. 4.6: Firemen extinguish the fire by throwing water under pressure
Find out the telephone number of the
fire service in your area. If a fire
breaks out in your house or in your
neighbourhood, the first thing to do
is to call the fire service.Does your city/town have a fire
brigade station?
When a fire brigade arrives, what
does it do? It pours water on the fire
(Fig. 4 .6). W ater cools the combustible
material so that its temperature is
brought below its ignition
temperature. This prevents the fire
from spr eading. W ater vapour s also
surround the combustible material,
helping in cutting of f the supply of air .
So, the fire is extinguished.
You have lear
nt that ther e are three
essential requirements for producing
fire. Can you list these requirements?
These are: fuel, air (to supply
oxygen) and heat (to raise the
temperature of the fuel beyond the
ignition temperature). Fire can be
controlled by removing one or more of
these requirements. The job of a fire
extinguisher is to cut off the supply of
air, or to bring down the temperatur e
of the fuel, or both. Notice that the fuel
Rationalised-2023-24
COMBUSTION  AND FLAME 45The most common fire
extinguisher is water . But
water works only when
things like wood and paper
are on fire. If electrical
equipment is on fire, water
may conduct electricity
and harm those trying to
douse the fir e. W ater is
also not suitable for fires
involving oil and petrol. Do
you recall that water is
heavier than oil? So, it
sinks below the oil, and oil
keeps burning on the top.
For fires involving electrical equipment and inflammable materials like
petrol, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the best extinguisher . CO2, being heavier than
oxygen, covers the fire like a blanket. Since the contact between the fuel and
oxygen is cut off, the fire is controlled. The added advantage of CO2 is that in
most cases it does not harm the electrical equipment.
How do we get the supply of carbon dioxide? It can be stored at high pressure
as a liquid in cylinders. In what form is the LPG stored in cylinders? When
released fr om the cylinder , CO2 expands enor mously in volume and cools down.
So, it not only forms a blanket around the fire, it also brings down the
temperatur e of the fuel. That is why it is an excellent fir e extinguisher . Another
way to get CO2 is to release a lot of dry powder of chemicals like sodium
bicarbonate (baking soda) or potassium bicarbonate. Near the fire, these
chemicals give off CO2.
CAUTION  : Do not handle the gas
stove yourself. Ask your parents
to help.

in most cases cannot be eliminated.
If, for instance, a building catches fire,
the whole building is the fuel.
4.3Types of Combustion
Bring a burning matchstick or a gas
lighter near a gas stove in the kitchen.
Turn on the knob of the gas stove. What
do you observe?We find that the gas bur ns rapidly
and produces heat and light. Such
combustion is known as rapid
combustion .
There are substances like
phosphorus which burn in air at room
temperature.
The type of combustion in which
a material suddenly bursts into
flames, without the application of any
apparent cause is called 
spontaneous
combustion.
Rationalised-2023-24
SCIENCE 46
Spontaneous combustion of coal dust
has resulted in many disastrous fires
in coal mines. Spontaneous forest
fires are sometimes due to the heat
of the sun or due to lightning strike.
However , most for est fir es ar e due to
the carelessness of human beings. It
is important to remember that the
campfires must be completely
extinguished before leaving a forest
after a picnic, or a visit.
We generally have fir eworks on
festival days. When a cracker is ignited,
a sudden reaction takes place with the
evolution of heat, light and sound. A
large amount of gas formed in the
reaction is liberated. Such a reaction is
called explosion.  Explosion can also take
place if pressure is applied on the
cracker .
4.4Flame
Observe an LPG flame. Can you tell the
colour of the flame. What is the colour
of a candle flame?
Recall your experience of burning a
magnesium ribbon in Class VII. If you

Light a candle (Caution : Be careful).
Hold a 4 -5 cm long thin glass tube
with a pair of tongs and introduce
its one end in the dark zone of a
non-flickering candle flame
(Fig. 4.10). Bring a lighted
matchstick near the other end of the
glass tube. Do you see a flame
caught at this end of the glass tube
after a while? If so, what is it that
produces a flame? Notice that the wax
near the heated wick melts quickly.
The substances which vapourise
during burning, give flames. For
example, kerosene oil and molten wax
rise through the wick and are vapourised
during burning and form flames.
Charcoal, on the other hand, does not
vapourise and so does not produce a
flame. In Activity 4.5, could the vapours
of wax coming out of the glass tube be
the cause of the flame produced?

Fig. 4.14 : Goldsmith blowing through a
metallic pipe4.6What is a Fuel?
Recall that the sources of heat energy
for domestic and industrial purposes
are mainly wood, charcoal, petrol,
kerosene etc. These substances are
called fuels. A good fuel is one which is
readily available. It is cheap. It burns
easily in air at a moderate rate. It
produces a large amount of heat. It does
not leave behind any undersirable
substances.
There is probably no fuel that could
be consider ed as an ideal fuel . We
should look for a fuel which fulfils most
of the requirements for a particular use.
Fuels differ in their cost. Some fuels
are cheaper than others.
Make a list of fuels familiar to you.
Group them as solid, liquid and gaseous
fuels as in Table 4.3.
4.7Fuel Efficiency
Suppose you were asked to boil a given
quantity of water using cow dung, coal
and LPG as fuel. Which fuel would you
prefer? Give your r
eason. Y ou may take
the help of your parents. Do these three
fuels produce the same amount of heat?
The amount of heat energy produced on
complete combustion of 1 kg of a fuel is
called its calorific value. The calorific
value of a fuel is expressed in a unitFig. 4.13 : Different zones of candle flame

particles. These fine particles are
dangerous pollutants causing
respiratory diseases, such as asthma.
2.Incomplete combustion of these
fuels gives carbon monoxide gas. It is a
very poisonous gas. It is dangerous to
burn coal in a closed room. The carbon
monoxide gas produced can kill persons
sleeping in that room.
For centuries, wood was used as
domestic and industrial fuel. But now
it has been replaced by coal and other
fuels like LPG. In many rural parts of
our country, people still use wood as a
fuel because of its easy availability and
low cost. However , burning of wood gives
a lot of smoke which is very harmful for
human beings. It causes respiratory
problem. Also, trees provide us with
useful substances which are lost when
wood is used as fuel. Moreover cutting
of trees leads to deforestation  which is
quite harmful to the environment, as
you learnt in Class VII.Table 4.4 : Calorific V alues of dif ferent

Oh! So, that is why we are
advised never to sleep in a

Burning of Fuels Leads to Harmful
Products
The increasing fuel consumption has
harmful effects on the environment.
1.Carbon fuels like wood, coal,
petroleum release unburnt carbon3.Combustion of most fuels releases
carbon dioxide in the environment.
Increased concentration of carbon
dioxide in the air is believed to cause
global warming .
Global warming is the rise in
temperature of the atmosphere  of the
earth. This results , among other things,
in the melting of polar glaciers , which
leads to a rise in the sea level, causing
floods in the coastal areas . Low lying
coastal areas may even be permanently
submer ged under water .
4.Burning of coal and diesel releases
sulphur dioxide gas. It is an extremely
suffocating and corr osive gas. Mor eover ,
petrol engines give off  gaseous oxides
of nitrogen. Oxides of sulphur and
nitrogen dissolve in rain water and form
acids. Such rain is called acid rain . It is
very harmful for crops, buildings
and soil.
The use of diesel and petrol as fuels
in automobiles is being replaced by
CNG (Compressed Natural Gas), because
CNG produces the harmful  products in
very small amounts. CNG is a cleaner fuel.called  kilojoule per kg  (kJ/kg).
Calorific values of some fuels are given
